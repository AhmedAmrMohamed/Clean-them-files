#### A Real-Life Example Of The Problem

In my Music library there are over 870 songs, among these songs there are songs with the following filenames:

```
001.  Calvin Harris & Dua Lipa  -  One Kiss.mp3
023. Calvin Harris - One Kiss (ZHU Remix).mp3
030.  Calvin Harris & Dua Lipa  -  One Kiss.mp3
35. Calvin Harris, Dua Lipa - One Kiss.mp3
167.  Calvin Harris & Dua Lipa  -  One Kiss.mp3
```

now I really don't like having the same song five times in my library under different names. And since there are many other examples, I can't go manually through my library removing every duplicated file under different name.  

```clean-them-files``` or  ```CTF``` solves this problem, after running the in my music directory only one ```one kiss``` song remained while all others were removed.



#### Progress So Far

```CTF``` runs as really well as python code but I'm yet to turn it into a CLI tool and add it to my beloved ```asd``` but since it has already helped me clean my directory I  am yet to find a motive to finish the last two steps :P
